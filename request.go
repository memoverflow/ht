	// State is a place which is recommended as storage for passing information
	// through middleware and to your frontend views.
	//
	// State will be empty if you or your middlewares don't set it manually.
	//
	// It's recommended to using a namespace prefix to avoid key name conflict,
	// like "mysession:session_id", especially for middleware libraries.
	//
	// State's value type is just interface{}, so you can cast it to it's own
	// type using type assesions (https://tour.golang.org/methods/15).
	//
	// For middleware library authors, you should provide utility functions to
	// extract the actually value, with type casting and namespace demangling.
	// For example, mysession middleware can provide a function with type
	// mysesion.GetSession(*vox.Request) *mysession.Session
	State map[string]interface{}
	// Next will call the next handler / middleware to processing request.
	// It's the middleware's responsibility to call the Next function (or not).
